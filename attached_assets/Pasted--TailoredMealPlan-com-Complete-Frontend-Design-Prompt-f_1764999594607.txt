### 8. IMPORTANT DESIGN NOTES

1. **No Backend Required:** All forms should show static success states. No actual data processing.

2. **Use Placeholder Images:** Use Unsplash or placeholder services for food images. Suggest searches: "healthy meal", "salad bowl", "grilled chicken", "breakfast oatmeal"

3. **Consistent Spacing:** Use 8px grid system. Spacing: 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px

4. **Accessibility:** Proper contrast ratios, focus states, alt text for images

5. **Animations:** Subtle hover effects, page transitions, loading states. Don't overdo it.

6. **Mobile First:** Design for mobile, then scale up to desktop

7. **Error States:** Design empty states, error messages, 404 page

8. **Dark Mode (Optional):** If time permits, add dark mode toggle
