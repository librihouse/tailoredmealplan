     * Each day has breakfast, lunch, dinner (and snacks if selected)
     * Grocery list aggregates quantities across all 7 days
     * Unit conversions are practical (e.g., 19 tbsp → 1 cup + 3 tbsp)
   - Note any issues or improvements needed

3. Test Monthly Plan Generation:
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Click "Monthly" tab (should be unlocked now)

     * Each day has complete meals with nutrition
     * Grocery list properly aggregates across all 30 days
     * No timeout errors occur
     * PDF export works correctly
   - Note any issues or improvements needed

STEP 3: IMPROVE MEAL PLAN QUALITY

During testing, identify and document issues:

1. Common Issues to Watch For:
   - Missing days in monthly plans (should have all 30 days)
   - Incomplete meal data (missing ingredients, instructions, nutrition)
   - Grocery list not properly aggregated
   - Unit conversions not practical
   - Timeout errors during generation
   - PDF export issues

2. Document Issues:
   - Note the plan type (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Record the specific issue
   - Capture screenshots if possible
   - Note any error messages

3. Test Multiple Scenarios:
   - Different dietary preferences (vegan, keto, etc.)
   - Different health goals (lose weight, build muscle, etc.)
   - Different cuisines (Indian, Mediterranean, etc.)
   - Different calorie targets
   - Family member profiles (if testing Family plan)

4. Verify Credit Deduction:
   - Check credits before generation
   - Generate a plan
   - Verify credits deducted correctly:
     * Daily: 1 credit
     * Weekly: 2 credits
     * Monthly: 4 credits
   - Check credits after generation

STEP 4: TEST SUBSCRIPTION FEATURES

1. Verify Credit Reset:
   - Note current credit usage
   - Wait for billing period end (or manually trigger if possible)
   - Verify credits reset to 42 credits/month

2. Test Plan Limits:
   - Generate plans up to credit limit
   - Verify proper error messages when credits exhausted
   - Verify upgrade prompts appear

3. Test Family Plan Upgrade (Optional):
   - Upgrade from Individual to Family plan
   - Verify credit allocation: 210 credits/month
   - Test family member profile creation
   - Test meal plan generation for family members

STEP 5: FIX IDENTIFIED ISSUES

1. Prioritize Issues:
   - Critical: Plans not generating, missing days, timeout errors
   - High: Incomplete data, poor quality
   - Medium: UI/UX improvements
   - Low: Minor formatting issues

2. Apply Fixes:
   - Fix backend issues (timeouts, chunking, validation)
   - Improve prompt engineering for better quality
   - Fix frontend display issues
   - Update error messages

3. Re-test After Fixes:
   - Generate plans again with same parameters
   - Verify issues are resolved
   - Document any remaining issues

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- Always use Razorpay test cards (never real cards in test mode)
- Test in test mode only (verify API keys are test keys)
- Document all issues found during testing
- Test edge cases (very high/low calories, unusual dietary restrictions)
- Verify all 30 days are present in monthly plans
- Check grocery list aggregation accuracy
- Test PDF export for all plan types

TECHNICAL DEBT & FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

Known Issues to Address:
- Email notification system needs implementation
- Payment method management UI needs development
- Billing history page needs creation
- Legal pages need content
- FAQ page needs creation
- Pricing structure needs accuracy updates
- Business logic fixes needed before Individual plan testing

Current Work in Progress:
✅ Monthly plan locked for free tier (December 30, 2025)
   - Feature restricted to Individual and Family plans only
   - Free tier users see upgrade prompts
   - Backend validation prevents API bypass

🔄 Individual Plan Testing Phase (Next)
   - Test subscription upgrade using Razorpay test cards
   - Test all plan types (daily, weekly, monthly) on Individual tier
   - Monthly plan improvements will be tested and refined
   - Fix issues identified during free tier testing
   - Improve meal plan generation quality

Pending Improvements:
- Daily meal plan: Minor improvements identified during free tier testing (to be fixed during Individual plan testing)
- Weekly meal plan: Minor improvements identified during free tier testing (to be fixed during Individual plan testing)
- Monthly meal plan: Improvements will be identified and applied during Individual plan testing phase

Next Phase (Individual Plan Testing):
1. Test subscription upgrade from Free to Individual using Razorpay test cards
   - Follow RAZORPAY TESTING & PLAN UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS section
   - Verify upgrade flow works correctly
   - Verify credit allocation (42 credits/month)
2. Test all plan types on Individual plan tier:
   - Daily plans: Verify quality and fix any issues
   - Weekly plans: Verify quality and fix any issues
   - Monthly plans: Test chunked generation, verify all 30 days, improve quality
3. Fix identified issues:
   - Apply fixes for issues found during free tier testing
   - Improve prompt engineering based on test results
   - Fix any timeout or generation issues
4. End-to-end testing across all tiers

Future Enhancements:
- Recipe library and favorites
- Progress tracking dashboard
- AI chat support
- Referral program
- Advanced analytics
- Mobile app (future consideration)
